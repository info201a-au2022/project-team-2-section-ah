|Abstract | Our main question is what factors influence government corruption and transparency levels. This question is important because the billions of people that live under governmental control are having their lives positively or negatively influenced by a governing body; by answering this question, we would gain a better understanding of potential trends that cause this corruption and steps that can be taken to achieve a solution. To address this question, our project will filter through multiple csv files containing data on countries around the world, regions of the country, their government transparency levels, the changes in these levels over the years, and WGI indicators. |
|Keywords | Government systems, Country transparency, Citizen freedom, WGI reports, Global comparison |
|Introduction | Our project focuses on government corruption around the world. With technology advancing and communication speed at an all-time high, it is important to understand that not everything that we see or hear is true, especially when it comes to the government. Our project is designed to sort through government corruption index scores based on country, year, index score, global rank, and number of sources, with the goal of better understanding which countries are transparent with their affairs, which aren’t, and how to know who to trust. There are many factors that are accounted for, such as bribery, diversion of public funds, access to information on public affairs/government activities, and much more; however, this is all boiled down into one number, so that it is easier to comparatively rank the different governments against each other. This is relevant to our class because it deals with the extrapolation of multiple data points into a set, which we can then manipulate using the skills we have learned in class to make it easier to understand. |
|Problem Domain | **Project Framing:** Our first step will be to analyze the data set, and to look for the different factors and variables that we need to clean and organize. Then, we will use the R programming skills that we have learned in class and apply them to the dataset, in order to manipulate and arrange the data how we need. After, we will implement our data into data visualizations that will make our information easier to understand and look at for the audience. We will also use our data to answer the research questions and potential implications. Finally, we will demonstrate our findings to the class with a thorough presentation outlining the data, visualizations, and analysis. <br /> **Human Values:** Some of the various human values involved in this topic are trust, ethics, and transparency. These values originate from the concept that governments are designed to work cohesively with their citizens to provide and protect for them. However, in modern society, this is not always the case. Many governments are not completely honest with their citizens and are secretive about their motives and actions, resulting in a lack of trust and transparency. It is also an ethical matter as many governments are outright manipulating their own supporters in order to achieve their own goals. <br /> **Direct Stakeholders:** The direct stakeholders are individuals living under government authority. The purpose of a government is to provide citizens with a source of authority that is just and fair in order to promote growth and development. Consequently, citizens support the government with their resources because they are expecting support in return. However, when a government is not being transparent with its own citizens, corruption begins to form and this negatively impacts the citizens. The lack of transparency could be anything ranging from simple bending of laws to outright manipulation and fraud, which would directly impact the citizens of that country. <br /> **Indirect Stakeholders:** The indirect stakeholders are an entity such as the media outlet. They are in charge of reporting anything newsworthy such as the corruption of the government since their job is reporting news. Regular people may not be aware of government corruption. Businesses and private/public organizations outside of the government are impacted indirectly through taxes, laws, or ordinance that hurt them. Inefficient and/or corrupt governments may not have a direct negative impact on some businesses, but indirectly through things such as high taxation or inappropriate regulation that makes it more difficult to operate business. The internet, newspapers, and magazines, along with organizations that take this data to be true and not into the perspective of the governments are also considered indirectly involved. <br /> **Possible Harms and Benefits:** If the countries are corrupt, it is the government and individuals who finance the government that are harmed. Companies financing corrupt governments impact the people by funding away infrastructure investments such as railroads, roads and highways, and telecommunications. Additionally, citizens of the country are affected. For example, they may be denied basic necessities if government officials steal that away from them. Best jobs or contracts may be given to government official friends and families and people not connected to the government may live in poverty or fear. People do not trust corrupt governments and it can hurt businesses and favor some over others. Those who are in government or have access to government benefits from corruption. They could benefit financially, be protected from the law, or use government resources for private use.The media will benefit since they attract lots of viewers and they depend on them to stay in business. |
|Research Questions | **What are some commonalities between countries with low levels of transparency? What are commonalities between ones with high levels of transparency?** The motivating factor behind this question is to dig deeper into the cause of government corruption. By answering this question, we would be able to see the relationship between various factors and transparency. It is important to understand what is creating low and high levels of transparency in order to take the first step towards finding a solution. <br /> **What years are characterized by the highest and lowest levels of government transparency?** The motivating factor behind this question is the need to identify potential trends in government transparency and to understand if there is something at a global level that is influencing governments. It is important because it will help us to be able to see the state of the world through a new perspective; we would be able to tell if the government corruption situation is improving or deteriorating. <br /> **Which regions/countries have the lowest levels of transparency?** The motivating factor behind this question is the need to recognize the underlying causes of low levels of transparency. If a certain country or group of countries in an area all showcase low levels, that would hint at the existence of other potential influential factors such as economic state or political strife. Consequently, this question is important in understanding trends in government transparency and the reasons behind these trends. <br /> **What is the average change of ranking for each country?** The motivating factor behind this question is the need to establish trends in terms of significant ranking changes. This is important because it will help determine which countries are becoming more trustworthy, and which are becoming less so. We can also expand upon this to determine patterns in regions or certain years, and draw conclusions based on that analysis. For example, is there a region where all the countries are generally trending down in terms of transparency? Why is that? |
|The Dataset | **(1)** Our dataset is related to our problem domain and research questions because it contains information regarding various countries, their levels of transparency, and how those levels have changed over the years. We are trying to identify the factors that could potentially be influencing government corruption and these details are very helpful in understanding a potential trend or causation. By using these datasets, we are able to sort by country and region to track areas with high levels and histories of low government transparency, which would indicate the presence of government corruption. The dataset also contains the date at which the transparency level was recorded which would help in determining which years had high and low levels of transparency - another hint at a possible external factor influencing government corruption levels. Ultimately, the combination of dates, countries, regions, and transparency levels provide us with a large amount of helpful data to work with and uncover the factors that influence corruption throughout the world. <br /> **(2)** <table>  <thead>  <th>Name of Data File (.csv)</th>  <th># of Observations (rows)</th>  <th># of Variables (columns)</th>  </thead>  <tbody>  <tr>  <td>wgidataset.csv</td>  <td>4921</td> <td>40</td> </tr>  <tr>  <td>transparency_legacy.csv</td>  <td>2115</td> <td>10</td>  </tr>  <tr>  <td>transparency_active.csv</td>  <td>1819</td> <td>9</td>  </tr>  </tr>  </tbody>  </table> <br /> **(3)** how_to_code.

The contributor of the dataset is a Kaggle user, @how_to_code, a data engineer at Dashmote. Corruptions can cause instability if leaders give jobs to their friends/family members or if a politician uses public funds for personal gain. The money could have gone to schools or to develop infrastructure, but instead ends up in the pockets of a wealthy politician. Individuals who cause corruption for personal or corporate gain benefits from the data. They gain profit if their corporation makes more money. The media outlet also benefits from their viewers to gain profit. If the government is corrupt, it makes the media look less corrupt and adds to their credibility. Additionally, the dataset is credible and trustworthy. The data is available to the general public and is not proprietary. The dataset includes 3 data sources from 13 corruption surveys and the assessments were collected to be completed and analyzed of how corrupt a country is. Each country’s score depends on the results from various surveys.  Data was collected from various institutions including the World Bank (which provides funding to developing countries) and the World Economic Forum. The dataset sources its data from Transparency International, a non-profit research organization. The Transparency International uses the CPI, which is a measure of perceived corruption by aggregating data from a number of different sources. Founded in 1993 by employees of the World Bank, the mission of this organization is to prevent corruption and promote integrity. This organization has obtained a valid assessment of people’s perception of government corruption, and we can trust their statistical measure. |
|Expected Implications | One expected implication is that there needs to be more action from policymakers and government officials to cut down on corruption. For the countries with the lowest rankings and worst transparency scores, improvements must be made so that citizens can feel good about what their governments are telling them and to maintain a bond of trust. This all starts with the people at the top, whether it be through laws that regulate common sources of corruption or reelection of the officials themselves. Another expected implication is that technologists and designers will have to improve their detection of corruption so that officials who aren’t transparent are caught and exposed. This will lead to governments being more honest with their citizens, as they won’t be able to get around corruption detection software that designers are able to implement. Additionally, the fear of being exposed for their corruption will encourage officials to be more transparent. |
|Limitations | A limitation we have with the data is that the data sets have different variables of categorization. Most of the variables are the same, but some tables don’t have the same categories that others have. This could limit us in contrasting different countries across time periods because we won’t be able to make direct comparisons if some of the categories don’t line up. We can combat this by using join functions to get as many similar categories as we can, and compare countries that way. Another limitation we might have is that corruption is a broad concept, and could pertain to a variety of different issues. Obviously, any corruption is bad, but not all corruptions are created equally and have varying levels of severity. In the score and rank provided, there is no clarification in terms of whether the index accounts for that or not, so some scores could be out of proportion. We will deal with this limitation by treating all counts of corruption equally, as ultimately, any corruption is negative in the end. |
