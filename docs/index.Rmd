## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY
### Example 1: Source some code and run a function
```{r}
#make sure to go to Session -> Set Working Directory -> To Source File Location
source("~/info201/project-team-2-section-ah/source/table.R")
```

```{r}
source("~/info201/project-team-2-section-ah/source/chart_1.R")
```
This scatterplot displays the scores over the years for the location with the most  transparent government. This chart has two numerical variables: year and score, and it shows the changes of scores over the years. The score describes the corruption/transparency level, with 100 being the most transparent and 0 being the most corrupt. There is an slight increase from 2012 to 2014, then a decrease from 2014 to 2017, and then it roughly stays the same. Since the score has not increased nor decreased from 2017, people believe the government is transparent and their opinion about them has not changed.

```{r}
source("~/info201/project-team-2-section-ah/source/chart_2.R")
```

```{r}
source("~/info201/project-team-2-section-ah/source/chart_3.R")
```

### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it
```{r}
# Example 1: This function was "sourced" above
#msg <- data_access_test(" Morgan!")
```


## ABOUT THIS FILE: 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
